# 100-days-of-code
This is my log of 100 days of coding. There will be a variety of languages included, and I hope to use this as a measure of improvement since day 1.

# Who am I?
My name is Sohaib Ali, an emerging Freshman at the University of Michigan. As someone who will be majoring in Computer Science, I want to learn
as much as possible as well as build projects to learn more about coding. With 100 days of code, I want to not only learn more about computer programming, but
learn how to use Github as well, as it is a crucial application for developers.
