Today I finished my Rock Paper Scissors code from day02. The main.py file
from day02 was changed to rps.py. This code includes a fully simulated game
of rock paper scissors, where the player inputs their decision, and the 
computer choice is randomized. I also included test.py in which I wanted
to try to create the code without using a tutorial.
